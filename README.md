# ðŸ˜Ž Nice Try!

Youâ€™ve clearly got a good dev eye ðŸ‘€  
...which is exactly why you should join my community!

Inside **[The Scraping Edge](https://www.skool.com/the-scraping-edge-6500)**,  
youâ€™ll meet other sharp developers building **AI scrapers, agents, and automations**  
that *actually run themselves*, plus **AI tutorials**, the latest **AI tools and experiments** worth knowing,  
and learn how to **scale your AI projects** the right way.

All for free!

Thatâ€™s also where you'll get:  
- **Access to this repo** (with all scripts and YAML)  
- **Content and resources from all past and future videos**  
- Templates, JSON workflows, and private discussions that donâ€™t make it to YouTube  

No spam. Only **AI projects worth a developerâ€™s time (built by a developer).**

See you inside,
